- If *commit* is described, leave the second line blank;
- Add a description to the commit beginning from the third line, with 72 characters or less per line;
    - When asking yourself if a description is required for *commit*, ask yourself if anyone wants to investigate "why this change has been introduced" will only be possible by the title and content of *commit*;
    - Add a description that answers the question "Why is this *commit* necessary?";
- Refer to *issues* or *pull requests* at the end of the message;
